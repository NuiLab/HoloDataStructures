Assets>prefabs

Contains game objects ready to be placed in the scene.

Assets>scripts

Contains all of the code written for this project. Once the project gets more complicated, make sure to seperate the scripts
into scripts related to the environment and scripts related to the ship and the player

Everything you need will be under the Assets folder, and the two subfolders mentioned above contain the only things you will most likely require to work.

If you have problems opening the project, you could try renaming the project folder to ICAVE DEMO which was it's original name. 
I *really* doubt there are any issues with the rename but just putting that here to save you a possible headache.
